##  Daily Activity Log
---
**Day 1 — 16-12-2025**

Overview
Created a GitHub repository named **BridgeLabz-Training** and set up a working branch *core-java-practice*. Structured the project by creating three folders: `gcr-codebase`, `scenario-based`, and `leet-code-codebase`. Learned how to connect a remote GitHub repository to a local folder and understood the basic Git workflow.

Commands Practiced
```
git init
git status
git branch
```
---
Day 2 — 17-12-2025

Overview
Added **10 basic Java programs** under the Programming Elements folder in `gcr-codebase` and **solved 6 LeetCode problems** in `leet-code-codebase`. Practiced committing and pushing code to a branch. Faced an issue where commits were pushed to the main branch instead of core-java-practice, which was resolved by verifying and switching the active branch.

Commands Practiced
```
git add
git commit
git push
git branch
git switch
```
---
Day 3 — 18-12-2025

Overview
Completed **18 Java programs** from Programming Elements** (Level 1 & Level 2) in `gcr-codebase`. Learned to rename files using Git while converting naming conventions from camelCase to PascalCase. Practiced branch handling by cleaning unintended commits from the main branch and ensuring all work remained in core-java-practice.

Commands Practiced
```
git mv
git switch main
git switch core-java-practice
git fetch
git push --force
git status
```
