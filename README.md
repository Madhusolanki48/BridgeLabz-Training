##  About This Repository
This repository documents my **daily progress, assignments, and practice work** during the Bridgelabz training program.  
It is designed as a **learning log + code showcase**, reflecting consistency, clarity, and hands-on problem solving in Java.

##  Daily Activity Log
---
**Day 1 — 16-12-2025**

Created a GitHub repository named **BridgeLabz-Training** and set up a working branch *core-java-practice*. Structured the project by creating three folders: `gcr-codebase`, `scenario-based`, and `leet-code-codebase`. Learned how to connect a remote GitHub repository to a local folder and understood the basic Git workflow.

Commands Practiced
```
git init
git status
git branch
```
---
Day 2 — 17-12-2025

Added **10 basic Java programs** under the Programming Elements folder in `gcr-codebase` and **solved 6 LeetCode problems** in `leet-code-codebase`. Practiced committing and pushing code to a branch. Faced an issue where commits were pushed to the main branch instead of core-java-practice, which was resolved by verifying and switching the active branch.

Commands Practiced
```
git add
git commit
git push
git branch
git switch
```
---
Day 3 — 18-12-2025

Completed **18 Java programs** in `programming-elements` folder (Level 1 & Level 2) in `gcr-codebase`. Learned to rename files using Git while converting naming conventions from camelCase to PascalCase. Practiced branch handling by cleaning unintended commits from the main branch and ensuring all work remained in core-java-practice.

Commands Practiced
```
git mv
git switch main
git switch core-java-practice
git fetch
git push --force
git status
```
---

Day 4 — 19-12-2025

Worked on **Java Control Flows** Lab Practices and completed **40 Java programs** in a new `control-flows` folder under `gcr-codebase`.The practice included Level-1, Level-2 & Level-3 of Java control flow fundamentals such as boolean data types, boolean expressions, logical operators, conditional statements (if, else if, else), loops (for, while), control statements (break, continue), and the switch statement.This helped strengthen logical thinking and flow control in Java programs.

---

Day 5 — 20-12-2025

 - Solved **two real-world scenario-based Java problems** in the `scenario-based` folder under the `core-java-practice` branch, focusing on practical use of variables, input handling, conditional logic, loops, and clean coding practices.
 - Completed **20 array-based practice programs** in a new `arrays` folder inside `gcr-codebase`, covering array creation, access, modification, looping, and multi-dimensional arrays. This strengthened both real-world problem modeling and core data-structure fundamentals in Java.
